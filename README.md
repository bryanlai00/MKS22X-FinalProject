# Hollow World! (for now)

### Project Description
This game is best described as a hybrid of RPG and action-adventure similar to that of the original Zelda games (namely The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past) while drawing inspiration from Metroidvania series such as Hollow Knight.  The concept of the game is to clear rooms/floors of monsters in order to unlock the next room/floor.  The player will control a character and be able to move around, attack, and take damage.  There will be different presets of rooms and types of monsters.  Each elimination will add to the playerâ€™s score, and the game should continue so long as the player stays alive.
