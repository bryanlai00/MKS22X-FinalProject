# Hollow World!

### Project Description
This game is best described as a hybrid of RPG and action-arcade somewhat similar to that of the original Zelda games (namely The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past) while drawing inspiration from Metroidvania series such as Hollow Knight.  The concept of the game is to kill monsters inside an arena, granting the player score and prompting more to spawn.  The player will control a character and be able to move around, attack, and take damage.  There will be a variety of different types of monsters.  Each elimination will add to the playerâ€™s score, and the game should continue so long as the player stays alive.  The goal is to get the highest score you can.
